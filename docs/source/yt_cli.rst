Command-Line Interface
======================

A command-line interface (CLI) built using `Typer <https://github.com/tiangolo/typer>`_ serves as the main entry-point
to CyberAttackSim once it is installed. To access the simply CLI, run the following command from the Python environment
that CyberAttackSim is installed on.

.. code:: bash

    CyberAttackSim --help

**Output:**

   :alt: CyberAttackSim CLI with --help option

To make it easier to use the CyberAttackSim CLI, perform the completion installation.

.. code:: bash

    CyberAttackSim --install-completion

**Output:**

.. image:: ../_static/yt-cli-install-completion.png
   :width: 800
   :alt: CyberAttackSim CLI with --install-completion option

Now, when you hit the Tab key either before typing any option or while halfway through typing an option, the CLI will
display what matching options are available.
